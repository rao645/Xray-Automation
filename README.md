# Tutorial with tests implemented in Java and JUnit with Xray integration, using GitHub Actions.

This is a basic tutorial with some tests implemented in Java and JUnit.

The idea is to show how you can easily integrate you CI/CD pipeline implemented using GitHub Actions and have visibility of your automation results in Jira, using [Xray](https://getxray.app/).

## Questions

* _I have some questions..._
Well, if you have a Xray license, including trials, you can [reach out to Xray support](https://jira.xpand-it.com/servicedesk/customer/portal/2) for general API and Xray usage questions. However, questions related to this specific open-source project are not covered/handled by Xray support.

* _I have some suggestions..._
You can reach out to me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/darktelecom). However, please don't use to make support requests :)
